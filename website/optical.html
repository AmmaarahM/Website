		<h1>Facial Recognition</h1>
			<h2> Definition: </h2>
			<p> a method of identifying/ confirming an individual's identitiy using their face </p>
			<p> it works by matching the faces of people walking past cameras to images of people on a watch list</p>
			<p> the watch lists can contain poictures of anyone, incluing people who are not suspected of any wrongdoing </p>
			<h3>Disadvantages: </h3>
			<p> suveillance - people worry that the use of facial recognition creates the potential for mass surveillance, </p>
			<p> which could restrict an individuals freedom, whilst the technology could be used to trackdown criminals, </p>
			<p>	it could also allow them to track down ordinary and innocent people at any time </p>
			<p> scope for error - a slight chaange in camera angle or a change in appearance could lead to errors </p>
			<p> In 2018, it was reported that Amazon's facial recognition technolody had falsely identified </p>
			<p> 28 memebers of the US Congress as poeple arrested for crimes </p>
