		<p> Data centres consume the most amount of energy</p>
		<p> this is because, not only do the server need to be powered, but they also need to be cooled</p>
		<p>  In 2011, the US department for energy caluated that data centres in the US alone need...</p>
		<p> 70 billion kWh of electricity a year</p>
		<p> that is 2% of america's total power consumption</p>
		<p> which is the same as leaving over 80 million lightbulbs turned on! </p>
