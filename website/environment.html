			<div id="p">
				<p> e-waste refers to discarded electronic devices</p>	
				<p> technology is often difficult to repair,so often it's cheaper to replace a </p>
				<p> product than to repair it, this contributes to e-waste</p> 			
				<p> many consumers will replace working devices with a newer model each year,</p>
				<p> this also produces unncessary e-waste</p>
				<p> e-waste includes toxic chemicals,</p>
				<p> there are strict rules as to how e-waste should be disposed</p>
				<p> However, many organisations bypasss the rules by sending the e-waste to coutries with fewer regulations </p>
				<p> which affects their land and water supplies, which in turn affects the wildlife and the population </p>
