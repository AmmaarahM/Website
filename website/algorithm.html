		<h1>Algorithmic decision making</h1>
			<div id="box4">
				<p> Algorithms have many uses, some of these include; imaging dianosis, surgery, personalised medication,</p>
				<p> investment decisions, strategy formulation and perfomance evaluation.</p>
				<p> In some cases, algorithmic decisions are highly sought after, in others not so much</p>
				<p> This is often due to the fact that some decisions have a "higher stake" than others,</p>	
				<p> A higher stakes decision could be associated with credit lending, hiring, university admissions</p>
				<p> and, healthcare pioritisation</p>
				<p> In these scenarios, the decisions being made have a serious imapct on an individuals life and therefore </p>
				<p> raises concerns as the decision made by the algorithm could be incorrect and executed </p>
				<p> without an explanation, an individual could potentially lose out on getting a good credit score, </p>
				<p> which could have helped them get a mortgage or perhaps they could be denied access to healtcare as they are not seen as a "priorty".</p>
				<p> In these situations, the issue is the criteria used to evaluate the situation and whether it endanger the right to an explanation.<p>
